# JS-Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To use the calculator, simply enter the numbers and the operator into the input field, and press the "=" button to see the result. You can also use the "C" button to clear the input field.

I hope you find the JavaScript Calculator useful! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.
